# image-detection-with-math
# Problem  From an image, use the gradient concept to detect edges in the image and perform matrix multiplication operations on the image.   ## Steps to detect edges:   1. Calculate the gradient vector (partial derivative) of each pixel for each of the x and y axes with the formula:  $ \dfrac{\partial I}{\partial x} , \dfrac{\partial I}{\partial y} $  2. Calculate the gradient magnitude of each pixel with the formula:   $ \sqrt{\displaystyle(\dfrac{\partial I}{\partial x})^2 + (\dfrac{\partial I}{\partial y})^2} $   3. make a matrix operation with any value that corresponds to the image size and according to the matrix multiplication rule.
